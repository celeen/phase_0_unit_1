# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

	**I think it's fantastic practice. Sort of a flexible "one-well-built-design-for-all-purposes" model makes websites thorough and versatile, and saves timein the long run.**

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

	**Planning for diferent methods of input (touch) and so many different varieties of viewing platforms really forces design to be instrinsically versatile, and kinf of amorphous. Finding that happy medium between a design that will be decisive but not too rigid seems like a fun challenge.**
	
	**In the Future? I can only imagine that design will me more focused on newer types of input, and newer types of output. We will have to continue to adapt and hopefully standards will become broader, and as HTML and CSS continue to evolve, we will see more broader definitions continue to be built into the languages (ie. media queries instead of media types)**

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

	**Using any kind of electronic device without my eyes gets tedious for me; but I have seen blind people navigate using voice over, and it's amazing how much more convenient it is for people who are familiar with the tools (like anything). We should definitely design and develop for them. It's just the right thing to do. We should make sure we're not just designing the content of each page to work well with the existing systems, we should make sure the existing systems are convenient for blind people to use, ie. accessible to a large range of people.**

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

	**I have grasped all the philosophy surrounding responsive web design well, and a lot of the basic technical concepts, but I'm still just so bad at CSS that I am confused as to how to manage all these tools. Specifically, I keep trying to use chrome's emulator and it keeps not working the same way that my phone does. But only on this practice code. Why?**
