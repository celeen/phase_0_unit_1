# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

	**twofold:**
	
**1) balancing this with work, and home responsibilities. I work five 9 hour days a week, and the commute is an hour each way. That eats up 55 hours a week, and sometimes it's difficult to approach a problem in just an hour over my lunch break, or two hours after getting home from working the closing shift, eating dinner, and feeling exhausted.**

**2) I have to make an effort not to waste time going too far beyond the requirements.But that's hard because it's been really easy for me to get into flow on some of these assignments, and when I'm there, I don't want to stop it.**

* How will you combat that? 

**1) I have found that so far, I've been anxious to get as much as I can done on my two days off. But, if I examine the material ahead of time, I can figure out what assignments or reading is manageable during my lunch breaks, or on the train, or what challenges are best to start/finish tackling before or after work (depending on my schedule). Segmenting the challenges into reading, doing, and reflecting has helped me a lot. Seeing them as three separate tasks helps my ability to focus and absorb and learn so much.**

**2) I think there's a certain amount of flexibility and awareness in this context. It's okay for me to spend some time going further than I'm required to in once activity, even if it means I don't finish a different activity completely. Going past the finish line ins the first instance means I'll have more time to catch up later on the second. It's okay to do things out of order sometimes. Awareness seems key.**

* What techniques will you try?

	**I am excited to start meditating again! I started for a bit before my interview, reading "Search Inside Yourself" and the difference was phenomenal. I look forward to feeling less stressed about the workload as I get more accustomed to it, and as I start meditating regularly.**

	**I will also try to just be more aware. ie., If my attention starts to wander regularly, maybe it's time for a break, or to take a walk, or something.**
	
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

**I plan on taking it as it comes. One week at a time. As we get the material for each week, I will segment it, figure out a flexible plan for tackling it, and aim for having it done by the end of my second day off each week (we'll see if that'll happen- that will almost never be later than Friday).**

**I will take notes as I go on questions I have, and points I want to return to. Go farther than asked when I can, but won't stress about not being able to get things done if I don't have time. I will try to be organized, and I will likely fall short of my own aims there, but my efforts will ensure a large measure of success in learning and absorption. In general I want to work hard, but also be productive. I need to maintain realistic expectations; I need to avoid wasting energy on feeling disappointed in myself for not doing something good enough, and just keep practicing.**
