# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

	**I'm actually still not sure what they are. I will have to do some more research into that, but my impression they are a group of rules/guidelines for web development to make sure that code is relatively unified.**

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

	**I'm not sure I understand what you're referring to. If it's the sort of standard way we tend to structure HTML files? Yes. First the browser needs to know what it's reading: `<!doctype html>`. The head is all the information the browser needs to know first, then the rest tends to be formed around an outline, which is typically how any document on paper is formed; on the web there's just more opportubnity for responsiveness.**

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

	**I do! I feel at least in my own web design endeavors, and those that I had learned from or mimicked, I had tended to just tag various divs with "Header" "footer" etc. It's really nice to have those kinds of tools built into the language.**

* Why is reset.css necessary? 

	**Browsers have built in CSS rules that will carry into your documetn every now and then if you don't reset them. Womp-womp.**


* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

	**I was just noticing that today. I switched from safari to chrome for the devtools exercise, and noticed that facebook looks way different. Nicer. I dig.**
	
	**However, I'm kind of torn on whether it's good or bad that sites looks different in different browsers. It makes sense that developers of a browser would want to make in unique (probably aiming for unique in a positive way), but the de-standardization of how browsers read webpages can be a PAIN. I tihnk I would prefer for developers to be in charge of adding the code that gives the website it's look, and the developers of the browser to draw the functionality line before that.**

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

	**Kind of interesting:<br>

	**This laid out the @font-face issue for me very clearly:

	**This one gets kind of in depth about HTML5 semantics:
