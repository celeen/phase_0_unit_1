# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

	**the DOM is basically a way of mapping the structure of a site using the html. IT's super intuitive, because the way HTML is built already contains that structure: nothing needs to be added. I like the way chrome dev tools includes the CSS in the DOM, and reminds you which pieces are inherited to which elements in a readable, immediate way.**

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

	**Wordpress sites are all javascript, it seems! the content is still in blocks, but is less flexible than the site I built from the ground up. All of the posts on this wordpress site depend on javascript internally. I don't know if there's any advantage to that in the long run; from where I'm sitting right now it seems to make things needlessly complicated.**


* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

	**Yes. It was fun, it was helpful; I tihnk it's a great way to learn, and to tinker. Parts of it were confusing. I think in the long run I would be frustrated by how much more complicated it makes version control and permanent saving of files. I would prefer to tinker and have a place to go back to one tinkered version, if that makes sense. When I'm working, I tend to go on marathons, and forget what I'm doing until it's too late.**

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

	**The DOM really solidified when I started seeing javascript in there, and kind of understanding that javascript used objects in the DOM to refer to and interact with different parts of the page. Learning about the network tab was a big aha moment. That one is still settling. And Post Machina's website is beautiful! Very thoughtful.**
