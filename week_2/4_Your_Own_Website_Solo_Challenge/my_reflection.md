# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: [celeen.github.io](celeen.github.io)

Discuss the following:

* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

	**I feel like I learned so much! The initial design of my site, structurally, seemed super easy, but I ran into some roadbloacks after that. I feel like I understand the theory, and I just need a lot more practice at the code, and how it gets oput into practice.**

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

	**It was okay. Mostly I felt a mix of intimidated by other people's sites, and excited to learn how they had acheived what they did. I tihnk if I'd had more time to work on it, I would have had a lot more fun. I think I will have fun as I continue to work on it.**

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

	**I made some, in restrospect, unwise decisions about my skills and which methods to use. I got really excited about using icon fonts and ended up spending two hours trying to figure out how to implement unicode through icomoon, and it still didn't work, and I still don't know why. I am looking forward to pairing with someone over that later. So, that wasn't a wise use of time.**
	**Otherwise, I tried to make the design easy enough to handle in the short time frame I had, but complicated enough to challenge me. I almost succeeded at that; I have a basic structure so close to being done. I have to figure out how to style my two bottom nav divs so that they stay box-shaped, and hopefully- eventually- have background images.**
	
	**Looking back, I may have bitten off more than I had the skill to chew in the timeframe I had. It seems simpler than it was. I am excited though, because once I have it done and organized, I will have a lot of valuable work done (ie. I won't have to completely change anything around in the future- I think I'll be easily able to build on it.)**
	
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

	**As I said above, I want to make the background images work without looping, if I can. I might have to just choose a different approach. The bigger challenge is going to be that I built in a blog intro page. How am I going to structure that? Simple links to each blog entry? I think so. Just in a row from top to bottom, maybe with different colors or images behind them.**
	
	**I need to add a color scheme to it, as well.**

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

	**There are a lot of assumptions made in these blog posts about skill level. They explain the theory really well, but I repeatedly found that the authors assumed a certain level of skill knowledge. I went on a lot of google search trails from one article to another, trying to find the search term that would give me what I want. In the most tedious instance, I finally found [this](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/unicode-a-beginners-primer--webdesign-18005), but it still didn't help in practice. I still don't know enough to being to know what I was doing wrong.**

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

	**I really ought to start keeping a list to copy and paste into this.**
